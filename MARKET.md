# Pixels Camp Market

The Pixels Camp open market is a way for participants to sell or buy services during the event using the EXP tokens in their balances.

Anyone can apply to sell a service, and anyone can buy services from others.

You can purchase a service to get help for your team, for example requesting time from a web designer, or get access to an exceptional mentor, or to advertise your project. Imagination is the limit.

The reasoning behind is, you spend and earn EXPs to increase your chances of winning the hackathon, either because you need the service because you'd get a better project, or because you need the money to invest in it.

## Using the market

To use the market, you need to be on [Slack][1] and join the channel #market.

Once there, our @el_pixel bot will listen to your requests:

**services**

Will list the available services you can buy. Each service has an ID, name, contact, and the cost in EXPs.

```
services
```

**buy**

Signal that you want to buy a service, and the address you will transfering your EXPs from:

```
buy 7 0x3D417b8305aA60688385a1Ca56530130C77F8739
```

This will trigger a private message with instructions on how to proceed for your payment.

## Selling a service

You can apply to sell a service of your own in the market too.

Send an email to [market@pixels.camp](mailto:market@pixels.camp) with the following information:

 * Title of what you're selling.
 * A samll description of what you're selling, with possible duration of service, if it applies (1 paragraph).
 * You e-mail and slack contacts.
 * An optional URL to a page that explains your service in more detai.

Our team will look into your application and decide if it's suitable to enter the market. If it is, the bot will list it, and anyone can buy it from then on.

## Questions?

Use [Slack][8], channel `#blockchain`. We'll be around.
